# Example: Simplified Tailscale Action with OIDC
#
# This workflow demonstrates the simplest way to use the Tailscale GitHub Action
# with OIDC authentication - no curl commands, just the action.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Configure Tailscale Trust Credential (see .github/docs/OIDC_SETUP.md)
# 2. Set repository secrets:
#    - TS_V2_OIDC_CLIENT_ID: Your Tailscale OIDC client ID
#    - TS_V2_OIDC_AUDIENCE: Your custom audience (e.g., "tailscale-ci")
#
# For complete setup instructions, see: .github/docs/OIDC_SETUP.md
